# Tue Due

A simple to do list

## Learning Goals

* First time using Typescript
* Webpack
  * Modules
  * Hositng website using webpack, switching away from GH Pages
* Create a more stylized UI
* Mobile responsive
* Better documentation

## How to Use
Click on the upper plus button to add a new list. Then one can click on the lower right button, or hit ENTER, to add a new todo to the current list.

Todos have the fields: title, description, due date, priority. Title is required, description and due date are optional.

Click on a todo to expand it to see more info and options to edit or delete the todo.

Checked todos will be greyed out, then erased on refresh or switching to another list.

When a list is selected, select it again to see edit and delete options pop up next to the page title.

Info is stored in local Storage. All user-inputted info will repopulate on refresh, along with the last selected list. 



## What I would like to add in the future
Ability to undo checked todos

Reorder todos based on priority, due date, etc.,

Add button to clear due date on edit form, otherwise it is a bit clunky to have to manually remove the dates
